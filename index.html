            Pollination have two types which is
            self-pollination and cross-pollination.
            Self-pollination happened when the pollen
            from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower,
            or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is the
            transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of
            another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination
            happened in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are
            positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower’s stigma. This pollination does
            not require an investment from the plant to provide
            nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.
